# Irrigation-Project

## Description
The aim of this project is to create an automated drip-irrigation system to water the plants at home. Using the raspberry pi and a soil moisture sensor, the moisture level of the soil will be updated on the mobile app. Whenever the indication reads that the soil is dry, the water pump can be turned on. The water pump can be controlled via the mobile phone. 

## Hardware requirements
1. Raspberry Pi 
2. Soil Moisture Sensor: In this project, I am using the Grove Kit soil moisture sensor.
3. Drip irrigation pipes assembly
4. Water pump
